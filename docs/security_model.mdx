title: Security Model
---

This document would explain the security model used in Ory. A good place to give a general explanation for 
and explain the reasoning behind why we do things the way we do them. 

This could either be a single document or we could turn it into an entire topic - depending on our needs.

This document would be linked to when we're talking about the Ory Tunnel, what it does, and why you need it 
when developing something locally.

Ory is the most complete and advanced open source platform offering a wide range
of modern tools solving authentication, authorization, access control,
application network security, and delegation. Ory implements a variety of
best-practice standards including OAuth 2.0 / OAuth 2.1, OpenID Connect, Zero
Trust Networking, Zanzibar Policy Framework, FIDO2 U2F, WebAuthn, TOTP, and many
more.

- [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is a fully customizable, API-only
  platform for login, two-factor authentication, social sign in, passwordless
  flows, registration, account recovery, email / phone verification, identity
  and user management.
- [Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) is an API-only OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
  Connect provider that can interface with any identity and user management
  system (e.g. Ory Kratos, Firebase, your PHP app, LDAP, SAML ...).
- [Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a zero trust networking
  proxy and sidecar for popular ingress services and API gateways. It checks if
  incoming network request are authenticated and allowed to perform the
  requested action.
- [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is the world's first implementation of
  [Google's Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/) research paper, an
  infinitely scalable and blazing fast authorization and permission service.
  Think RBAC on globally distributed steroids.

The best place to run Ory software is in [Ory Cloud](https://www.ory.sh/). Ory
Cloud takes care of scalability, reliability, latency, availability, security,
and risk management for your authentication and authorization needs. Running Ory
software on Ory Cloud is as easy as:

```
$ bash <(curl https://www.ory.sh/install.sh) -b . kratos
$ kratos deploy --config=./import/config/from/config.yaml
```

Additionally, Ory Cloud offers administrative and user interfaces which you can
use to get started right away.

You can also run Ory software in Kubernetes, Docker, VMs, bare metal, FreeBDS,
Raspberry PI, ARMv5, Apple Silicon, and yes even Windows! It works everywhere
and does not even require libc, as it is written in [Go](https://golang.org).

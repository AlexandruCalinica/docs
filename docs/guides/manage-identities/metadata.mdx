title: Manage Metadata
---

Ory supports saving metadata for your identities. Examples of metadata may be:

- The subscription plan the identity is on;
- A credit score for the identity;
- The region of the identity;
- Any other application data.

Contrary to an identity's traits, the metadata can not be updated by the
identity using self-service flows, such as the settings flow.

Available metadata can either be hidden from the identity, meaning that it is
only available at administrative endpoints, or it can be visible to the
identity, implying that it is returned by `GET /sessions/whoami`:

- `metadata_public` is included in calls to `GET /sessions/whoami` as well as
  all administrative endpoints;
- `metadata_admin` is only available at administrative endpoints - it is hidden
  from the identity;

Please be aware that metadata can currently only be set using
`POST /admin/identities` and `PUT /admin/identities/{id}`. Modifying these
fields through web hooks is tracked as
[kratos#2412](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2412).

Metadata is currently not validated using the Identity JSON Schema.

## Metadata Example

Lookup Secrets, also known as Backup Codes or Recovery Codes, can be used to perform
2FA when the user doesn't have access to their selected 2FA method. 

Lookup Secrets are: 

- server-generated
- valid for a single use
- non-expiring - they become invalid only when the user generates a new set of
  codes

If you enable Lookup Secrets, users can get a list of codes that they must store securely
for future use. This is how it looks in the UI:

After the server generates the codes, the user must confirm that they received them. To confirm, 
the user must have a privileged Session. 

If the privileged session expired, the user is prompted to authenticate:

:::warning

The codes are valid only when the user confirms they received the codes.
It is the user's responsibility to generate new secretes before they use 
all of the available secrets.

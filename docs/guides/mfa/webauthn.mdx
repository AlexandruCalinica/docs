title: Overview
---

You can enable WebAuthn in the Ory Identity Service (Kratos) to allow users to perform 2FA with 
with physical devices such as USB keys or OS-level biometric authentication protocols, such as TouchID.

When users trigger the WebAuthn process, the web browser displays a prompt:

The look of the prompt depends on the web browser. The screenshot shows a Google Chrome prompt.

## Constraints

- WebAuthn is a browser-only standard. It doesn't work with native mobile apps.
- WebAuthn is limited to one domain and does not work in a local environment when using CNAME / Ory Proxy. 
  WebAuthN uses an `https://origin` URL as part of the client-server challenge/response mechanism. This mechanism allows a single URL 
  as the origin. To learn more, read this [WebAuthn discussion and on GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1372).
- Depending on the framework you use, implementing WebAuthn in your own UI can be challenging. 
  Check out the [reference implementations](../../kratos/guides/custom-ui) to see how you can approach implementation for different app types (web app, SPA).

## Writing E2E Tests

When writing end-to-end (E2E) tests for WebAuthn implementation in your app, 
[you can reference the Cypress tests used in Ory Identity Service (Kratos)](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/fc2cecfbeab811aa1a851f953b6bc2a4c119c412/test/e2e/cypress/integration/profiles/mfa/webauthn.spec.ts).

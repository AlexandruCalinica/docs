title: Ory Cloud architecture
---

This document could contain an overview of the architecture of the Ory Cloud ecosystem.- how the components communicate with each
other, what are their general capabilities and responsibilities.

This overview would be written from the Ory Cloud perspective and could be used to stress the benefits of using a managed
solution, or at least to highlight the differences between managing Ory components in-house and using the cloud solution.

Cloud users would get a better understanding of the data flow, dependencies, and interactions between the components. If we decide
to provide short descriptions of the tasks/capabilities handled by the components, Cloud users could also use this section to get
guidance as to where in the product documentation they can find the topics that are of interest to them.

The content found on this page (and the diagrams) could serve as a starting point: https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/projects

title: Architecture
---

This document could contain an overview of the architecture of the Ory ecosystem. What I mean by that, is how the components
communicate with each other, what are their general capabilities and responsibilities. 

This overview would be written from the Ory Cloud perspective, which means that, at least in the initial phase, 
we'd have to somehow deal with the fact that not all components are available and functioning in the cloud. 

This document would be useful to both Cloud and "OS" users. 

- Cloud users would get a better understanding of the data flow, dependencies, and interactions between the components. 
If we decide to provide short descriptions of the tasks/capabilities handled by the components, Cloud users could also
use this section to get guidance as to where in the product documentation they can find the topics that are of interest 
to them. 

- Open-source users could use this architecture diagram as an indication of "good practices" to use when setting up 
an Ory environment.
